## Missing Market Prices

![Missing Market Price Warning Row](missing-market-price-warning-row.png)

You may have to review and update transactions where there is no market price available. This error can occur when you add a transaction for a coin or currency that CryptoTaxCalculator doesn't have historical market pricing data. Some common circumstances include; coins that are not traded often, have low liquidity, newly created, are unlisted, or were ICO transactions. Due to the way we obtain our historical pricing information from data aggregators, in these situations, CryptoTaxCalculator assumes a zero dollar price:
